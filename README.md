# Refactoring the Horiseon Webpage

## Purpose

This is an exercise of improving web accessibility by taking existing code and refactoring it. This will ensure that people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies and help position the business well in search engines like Google.

## Task

For the webpage to meet accessibility standards, HTML elements are made semantic and follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. Alt attributes are added to image elements and when the heading attributes are viewed, they will fall in sequential order. Lastly, the title element is now concise and descriptive.
